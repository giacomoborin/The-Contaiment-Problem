%TODO Should I say that R is always commutative with unity


\section{Associated primes}

Let $ R $ be a commutative ring with unity, and $ \A $,$ \B $ two ideal, we say that the ideal
\begin{equation*}
	(\A : \B) = \{ x \in R \,|\, x\B \subseteq \A  \}
\end{equation*}
 \nocite{AMCD}
is the \textit{ideal quotient}. For the case in which $ \A $  is the null ideal $ 0 $ we define the \textbf{annihilator} of $ \B $ as:
\begin{equation*}
	\Ann_R(\B) = (0 : \B) = \{ x \in R \,|\, x\B = 0  \}
\end{equation*}
We can obviously omit the index $ R $ if it is clear by the context. In general given an $ R  $-module $ M $ and a set $ S \subseteq M $ non empty we can define its annihilator as:
\begin{equation*}
	\Ann_R (S) = \{ x \in R \,| xS = 0  \} = \{ x \in R \,|\, \forall s \in S \; xs = 0  \}
\end{equation*}

\begin{deff}[Associated Prime]
Let $ M $ be an $ R $-module. A prime ideal $ \p \subseteq R $ is an \textbf{associated prime} of $ M $ if there exists a non-zero element $ a \in M $ such that $ \p = \Ann_R (a)$. \\
We define $ \Ass_R(M) $ as the set of the associated primes of $ M $.\\
For an ideal $ I $ we say that a prime is associated to $ I $ if it is associated to the $ R $-module $ R/I $.
\end{deff}

Between the associated primes of an ideal we distinguish the minimal elements, that are called \textbf{isolated primes}, whilst the other one are said \textbf{embedded primes}.

We can define also the concept of minimal primes of ideal $ I $, that are the minimal ones that contains $ I $. In Noetherian rings these concepts are redundant, infact with the following proposition we have that minimal and isolated are equivalent. 

\begin{prop} \label{prop:minprimes}
	For a Noetherian ring $ R$, the minimal primes of $ R $ are among the associated primes of $ R $
\end{prop}

\section{Primary decomposition}

%TODO Mettici qualcosa di meglio dai
We would like to have some sort of factorization for the ideals of a ring, more general than the \textit{unique factorization domains}, in fact this is useful only for principal ideals. With this objective \textbf{primary decomposition} was introduced. 

Now I will recall some of the principal result on this topics, contained in \cite[Section 7]{Reid} and \cite[Section 4 and Page 83]{AMCD}

\begin{deff}
	An ideal $ \A $ in a ring $ R $ is said primary if $ R/\A$ is different from zero and all its zerodivisors are nilpotent, otherwhise we can express this as:
	\begin{equation*}
		fg \in \aa \Longrightarrow f \in \A \text{ or } g^n \in \A \text{ for some } n >0
	\end{equation*}
\end{deff}

It is obvious that the radical of a primary ideal is a prime ideal, infact given $ fg \in \rad(\A)  $ we have $ (fg)^m = f^m g^m \in \A $ for $ m>0 $, and so $ f^m \in \A \Rightarrow f \in \rad(\A)$ or exists $ n>0 $ such that $ g^{mn} \in \A \Rightarrow g \in \rad(\A) $.

If $ \A $ is a primary ideal such that $ \rad(\A) = \p $ we say that $ \A $ is {$ \p $-primary}.

\begin{rems} \label{rem:power_primary} \quad 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The power of a prime ideal isn't always primary, for example if in $ R = \K[x,y,z] / (xy - z^2) $ we consider the prime ideal $ \p = (x,z) $ (it is prime since $ R / \p \simeq \K[y]$ that is an integral domain) we have that $ y $ is a zero divisor in $R/\p $ (since $ x $ is not zero and $ yx = z^2 = 0 $, since $z^2 \in \p^2 $) but it is not nilpotent since $ y^k \not \in \p^2 $ for all $ k>0 $
	\end{enumerate}
\end{rems}

We say tha an ideal $ \A \subseteq R $ has a \textbf{primary decomposition}  if there exists a finite set of primary ideal $ \{ \q_1 , ... , \q_n\} $ such that:
\begin{equation*}
	\A = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \q_i
\end{equation*}

In general such structure does not exists, but for $ R $ noetherian we can prove, using Noetherian induction and the concept of irreducible ideal, that every proper ideal has a primary decomposition.

\begin{deff}
	We say that a proper ideal $ \A $ is irreducible if it cannot be written as a proper intersection of ideal, i.e. :
	\begin{equation*}
		\A = \B \cap \Cc \Longrightarrow (\A = \B \text{ or } \A = \Cc)
	\end{equation*}
\end{deff}

\begin{lem}
	A proper ideal in a Noetherian ring $ R $ is always the intersection of a finite number of irreducible ideals.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $ \mathfrak{F} $ be the set of proper ideal such that the lemma is false. Let $ \A $ be a maximal ideal of $ \mathfrak{F} $, since it cannot be irreducible there exists $ \B $, $ \Cc $ strictly greater than $ \A $ ( so not in $ \mathfrak{F} $) such that $ \A = \B \cap \Cc $. This is absurd and so $ \mathfrak{F} $ is empty.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
	In a Noetherian ring every irreducible ideal is primary
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Modulo working in the quotient ring we can assume to work with the zero ideal. So we assume that the ideal $ 0 $ is irreducible and we consider $ x$, $y $ such that $ xy = 0 $ with $ y\neq 0 $, then $ x $ is a zerodivisor. So we have that $ y \in \Ann(x) $\footnote{For $ \Ann(x) $ we mean the annihilator of the principal ideal $ (x) $} and we consider the chain:
$$ \Ann(x)  \subseteq \Ann(x^2) \subseteq ...$$
And for the ascending chain condition there exists $ m $ with $ \Ann(x^m)= \Ann(x^{m+1})$. \\
Now consider $ a \in (x^m)\cap (y) $, then $ a = bx^m $ and $ a = cy $, so since $ y \in \Ann(x) $ we have $ 0 = cyx = ax = bx^m x=  bx^{m+1}$, so $ b \in  \Ann(x^{m+1}) = \Ann(x^m) $, then $ a = bx^n = 0 $. So $ (x^m)\cap (y)=0 $ and since $ 0 $ is irreducible and $ y\neq 0 $ then $ x^m=0 $. 
\end{proof}

Combining this two lemmas we have that the decomposition for Noetherian ring. In literature we say that a commutative ring is a \textbf{Lasker Ring} if every ideal has a primary decomposition, so we can state that:

\begin{teo}[Lasker-Noether]
A Noetherian Ring is also a Lasker Ring
\end{teo}
Now we need to achive some kind of uniqueness. First of all we say that a decomposition $ \A = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \q_i $ is \textbf{minimal} if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $ \rad(\q_i) $ are all distinct
\item for all $ i $ we have $ \q_i \not \subseteq \bigcap_{j\neq i} \q_j $
\end{enumerate}

We can easly prove that from every decomposition we can obtain a minimal one using the following lemma:

\begin{lem}
If $ \A $ and $ \B $ are $ \p $-primary then $ \A \cap \B $ is $ \p $-primary
\end{lem}

Infact we can group the primaty ideal to get $ 1. $ and omit the superfluous terms to get $ 2. $

So we have two theorem of uniqueness for the prime \textit{associated}\footnote{not a random word} to a particular decomposition. 

\begin{teo}[First uniqueness theorem]
Let $ R $ be a Noetherian ring and $ \A $ an ideal with minimal decomposition $ \bigcap_{i=1}^n \q_i $, where $ \q_i $ is $ \p_i $-primary, then:
\[ \Ass(R/ \A) = \{ \p_1 , ... , \p_n \} \]
and so the set of primes $ \{ \p_1 , ... , \p_n \} $ is uniquely determined by the ideal

\end{teo}

This theorem show the strong ralation that we have between the associated prime ideal and the primary decomposition for Noetherian ring

\begin{teo}[Second uniqueness theorem]
Let $ R $ be a ring and $ \A $ an ideal with minimal decomposition $ \bigcap_{i=1}^n \q_i $, where $ \q_i $ is $ \p_i $-primary, then if $ p_i $ is a minimal element of $ \{ \p_1 , ... , \p_n \} $ $ \q_i $ is uniquely determined by the ideals $ \A $ and $ \p_i $.
%TODO Non so se lasciare sta roba tanto non serve
In particular if $ \phi : R \to R_{\p_i} = S^{-1} R$ is the canonical injection (where $ S = R \setminus \p_i $) we have
\[ 
\q_i = \phi ^{-1} ( S^{-1} \A  )
\]

\end{teo}


\section{Sybolic power}

	Lets consider an homogeneous polynomial ring $ k[x_0 , ... , x_n] $, it is easy to se that if we consider a variety $ X $ with it's coordinate ring $ R = k[X] $ and a point $ p \in X $ (associated to the maximal ideal $ \mm_p $)  we have that:
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:max_pow}
		\mm_p^n = \{ f \in k[X] \text{ such that } f \text{ vanishes in } p \text{ with multiplicity } n\}
	\end{equation}
	
	For general ideal we don't have similiar properties for the normal power of ideal, so we define the \textbf{symbolic power}. %TODO Qualcosa di più qui
	First of all given a prime ideal $ \p $ in a Noetherian Ring $ R $ we can define the $ n $-th symbolic power of $ \p $ as:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sym_pow_p1}
		\p^{(n)} = \{ r \in R \text{ such that exists } s \in R \setminus \p \text{ with } sr \in \p^n \}
	\end{equation}
	This definition show clearly the idea between the symbolic power, but is not easy to work with. We can have another equivalent definition that use the localization on the prime ideal $ R_\p $. Infact we can see it as the contraction of $ \p^n R_\p $ over $ R $:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sym_pow_p2}
		\p^{(n)} = \p^n R_\p \cap R
	\end{equation}
	In general the generic and symbolic power are different concept. It is obvious that $ \p^{n} \subset \p^{(n)} $ since $ 1 \not \in \p $. For the other direction we can costruct a counter example with the following proposition:
	\begin{prop}\label{prop:sym_is_primary}
		$ \p^{(n)} $ is the smallest $ \p $-primary ideal that contain $ \p^n $
	\end{prop}
	\begin{proof}\quad \\
		\textit{Primary}: If $ xy \in  \p^{(n)}$ with $ x \not \in  \p^{(n)}$ we have that exists $ s \not \in \p $ with $ sxy \in \p^n $. Suppose that $ sy \not \in \p $, so $ (sy)x \in \p^n $ and then $ x \in \p^{(n)} $ that is absurd, so $ sy \in \p \Rightarrow (sy)^n \in \p^n \Rightarrow s^n y^n \in \p^n$. Since $ \p $ is prime $ s^n \not \in \p $ and so $ y^n \in \p^{(n)} $. \\
		\textit{$p$-primary}: Infact $ \p^{(n)} \subset \p $ and so $  \rad  (\p^{(n)} )\subset \rad (\p) = \p$. Also if $ x \in \p $ we have $ x^n \in \p^n \subset \p^{(n)}  $ and so $ x \in \p^{(n)}  $.\\
		\textit{Minimal}: If $ \q $ is $ \p $-primary and contains $ \p^n $, then for $ r \in \p^{(n)}  $ there exists $ s \not \in \p \supset \q $ with $ sr \in \p^{(n)}  \subset \q $, and so since $ s \not \in \q  $ exists $ k $ such that $ r^k \in \q $. If $ k=1 $ we have finished otherwhise we terminate by induction using $ r r^{k-1} \in \q $.
	\end{proof}
	Using the same example from Remark \ref{rem:power_primary} we can observe that necessarly $ p^2 \neq \p^{(2)}  $ since the first one isn't prymary. 
	
	\begin{rems}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The proposition \ref{prop:sym_is_primary} establish a new equivalent definition for the symbolic power, more in line to the use of this ideal in the Zarisky-Nakata Theorem.
		\item Using the properties of localization, like \cite[Proposition 4.8]{AMCD} and working with the contraction we would have speed up the proof.
		%TODO Motiva perchè non lo hai fatto/di che lo farai dopo
		\end{itemize}
	\end{rems}
	
Now we can see the actual definition of this concept for a general ideal.

\begin{deff}
	Let $ R $ be a noetherian ring and $ I $ an ideal. Given an integer $ m $ we define the \textbf{$ m $-th symbolic power} of $ I $ as:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sym_pow_def}
		I^{(m)} = \bigcap_{\p \in \Ass(R/I) } (I^m R_\p \cap R)
	\end{equation}
\end{deff}



\section{Zarisky-Nagata Theorem}
Why do we study symbolic power? The Zarisky-Nagata Theorem give a geometric interpretation of its significance.

\begin{teo}[Zarisky-Nagata Theorem \cite{Zar49, Nagata62}] \label{teo:zarnaga}
	If $ R = k[x_0 , ... , x_n] $ is a polynomial ring and $ \p $ is a prime ideal then:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:zar_nag_teo}
	\p^{(m)} = \bigcap_{\substack{ \mm \in \mm\Spec (R)\\ \p \subset \mm}} \mm ^n
	\end{equation}
\end{teo}

Using the equation \ref{eq:max_pow} we can see that in this case the $ n $-th symbolic power of a prime ideal represents the ideal composed by all the polynomials vanishing on the variety with a multiplicity of $ n $, also indicated with the notation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ideal_vanish}
	I^{\left<n\right>} = \{ f \in R \text{ that vanishes on } \mathcal{V}(I) \text{ with multiplicity } n\}
\end{equation}

%TODO Posso prendere roba dagli articoli


\section{Fat Points}

Let's consider now an object of interest, that has particular relations with the symbolic powers.\\
Let $ k $ be a field and $ \PP^N$ the $ N $-th projective space over $ k $, consider now the distincts points $ p_1, ... ,p_k \in  \PP^N$ and some positive integers $ m_1 , ... ,m_k $. If we consider the defining ideals $ I(p_1), ... , I(p_k)  \subset k [\PP^N]$, representing the homogeneous polynomials vanishing on the point (before we have also used the notation $ \mm_{p_i}$ that emphasise their role as maximal ideals) we can define another ideal:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fat_pt}
	I = \bigcap_{i=1}^k I(p_i)^m_i \subset k [\PP^N]
\end{equation}
Since is intersection of homogenous ideals $ I $ is also homogeneous and we can use it to define a $ 0 $ dimensional subscheme $ Z \subset \PP^N $, called \textbf{fat point subscheme} and indicated as 
\[
Z = m_1 p_1 + ... +  m_k p_k
\]
And we will denote $ I $ as $ I(Z) $. This ideal represents the homogeneous polynomials that vanishes on $ p_i $ with multiplicity $ m_i $ for all $ i = 1, ... , k $. The support of the scheme is the set of points $ \{ p_1 , ... , p_k\} $.\\
The simbolic power of $ I(Z) $ has the particular from:
\[
I(Z)^{(m)} = \bigcap_{i=1}^k I(p_i)^{m_im}
\]
and so clearly represents the functions vanishing on $ p_i $ with multiplicity $ mm_i $ for all $ i = 1, ... , k $.

\subsection{Symbolic Powers and saturation of ideals}


\section{Relation between normal and symbolic power}
\begin{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Cosa trovata nell'intrdouduzione di \cite{BocciHrabourne10} , sarebbe carino riprendere un discorso simile}

Consider a homogeneous ideal I in a polynomial ring k[PN ]. Taking powers of I is a natural algebraic construction, but it can be difficult to understand their structure geometrically (for example, knowing generators of Ir does not make it easy to know its primary decomposition). On the other hand, symbolic powers of I are more natural geometrically than algebraically. For example, if I is a radical ideal defining a finite set of points p 1, . . . , ps  PN , then its mth symbolic power I(m) is generated by all forms vanishing to order at least m at each point pi, but it is not easy to write down specific generators for I(m), even if one has generators for I.

A natural question that arises is the relation between the two powers.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{teo}\label{teo:inv_cont}
	If $ R $ is a Noetherian reduced ring then $ I^r \subseteq I^{(m)}$  if and only if $ r \geq m $
\end{teo}
\begin{proof}
	Since if $ I=0 $ it is obvious we assume it to be non zero.\\
	The first implication is easy, infact for all $ \p $ we have that $ I^m \subset I^mR_\p \cap R $ since $ I \subset \p $\footnote{So nothing become zero} and $ 1 \not \in \p $.\\
	Suppose now that $ I^r \subseteq I^{(m)}$ and $ r < m $. Consider an associated prime $ \p $, then if we consider the localization $ I_\p $ we have:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $ (I_\p)^r = (I^r)_\p $ it is obvious
	%TODO Sono la stessa notazione I_\p e IR_\p ??????
	\item $ (I_\p)^m \supset (I^{(m)})_\p $, because $ I^{(m)} \subset I^mR_\p \cap R = I^m_\p \cap R $ and thus passing to the localization (again for the second term) we get the containment.
	\end{itemize}
	So composing this with the containment hypotesis (localized) we get $ (I_\p)^r = (I^r)_\p \subset (I^{(m)})_\p \subset (I_\p)^m $. Since the other inclusion is obvious we have $ I_\p^m= I_\p^r $, considering the intermediary power we have that $ I_\p I_\p^r =I_\p^r $, thus we can use the Nakayama Lemma:
	
	\begin{lem}[Nakayama] \label{lem:naka}
		Given an ideal $ I $ of a commutative ring with unity $ A $ and $ M $ a finetely-generated module over $ A $ with $ IM = M $, then there exists a $ x \in A $ such that $ x \equiv 1 \mod I $ and $ xM = 0 $
	\end{lem}
	%TODO Scolta non è che l'estensione di I in R_\p e l'estensione non sono la stessa cosa?
	In our case the ring is $ R_\p $, the ideal is $ I_\p $ and the module is $ I_\p^{r} $. So since $ R_p $ is a local ring with maximal ideal the localization of $ \p $, that is also the Jacobson Ideal, and $ I_\p ^r $ is contained in it. So for the characterization of the Jacobson ideal the element $ x $ is invertible and then $ I_\p^r = 0 $, but since we inherit that $ R_\p $ is a reduced ring this is possible only if $ I_\p = 0$. Since this is true for all the prime ideal (for the non associated one it is obvious since they intersect $ R \setminus I $) and this is a local property (\cite[Proposition 3.8]{AMCD}) we have $ I = 0 $, absurd.
\end{proof} 
Sadly the other direction of the containment isn't that easy, and it's an open question and in the last years was studied for some classes of ideals.

\chapter{The Containment Problem}
	\section*{}
	As stated before the Containment Problem, is an open question in Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra. The general form of the problem is:
	\begin{que} \label{que:cont}
		Given a (\textbf{Noetherian ???}) Ring $ R $ and an ideal $ I $, for which $ m,r $ positive integers we have the containment:
		$$ I^{(m)} \subset I^r $$
	\end{que}
	The problem posed in Question \ref{que:cont} is quite general and does not seem to have a unique and simple answer (as for the inverse one of theorem \ref{teo:inv_cont}). Usually we need to specify a particular ring and a particular ideal. Also we consider some precise pairs, like $ 3,2 $, or a subset given by a disequation. 
	\begin{rem}
	If the contaiment holds for $ m,r $ it does also for all $ m' ,r $ with $ m'\geq m $, since we have $ I^{(m')} \subset \cont{m}{r} $
	\end{rem}
	To better explain this let's see a celebrated result, showed in \cite{HocHun02,EinLazSmi01}:
	\begin{teo}{(Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith, Hochster-Huneke)}\label{teo:cont:bigh}
	Let $ R $ be a regular ring and $ I $ a nonzero, radical ideal, then if $ h $ is the big height of $ I $ we have that for all $ n \geq 0 $ we have:
	\[ \cont{hn}{n}\]	
	\end{teo} 
	
	To understand this theorem we need two concepts.
	For a Noetherian local ring $ (R,\mm) $ we say that it is regular local ring if the minimal number of generators of the maximal ideal is equal to the dimension of $ R $. The name came from a Zarisky's result: for an algebraic variety a point $ p $ is non singular (regular) if and only if the ring of germs in $ p $ is regular (\cite{Zar40}). Is possible to see this in a more modern way , infact for lemma \ref{lem:naka} (in a different form) is possible to show that $ R $ is regular if and only if $ \dim(\mm / \mm^2 ) = \dim (R) $, and from algebraic geometry $ \mm /\mm^2 $ is the cotangent space of the point corresponding to $ \mm $, so the tangent space has same dimension of the variety if and only if the localization is regular.\\
	In general we say that a Noetherian ring is \textbf{regular} if the localization at every prime ideal is a regular local ring. Also a geometrical interpretation of this definition is that for an affine variety $ V $ its ring of regular functions $ \mathcal{O}_V $ is a regular ring if and only if $ V $ is a non singualr variety. 
	
	Instead to define the height of a prime ideal ($\hgt ( \p )$) in a Noetherian Ring $ R $ is the supremum of the lenghts $ h $ of prime ideals chains descending from $ \p $:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:chain}
		\p_0 \subsetneq \p_1 \subsetneq ... \subsetneq \p_{h} = \p
	\end{equation}
	The concept of is equivalent to the codimension of the ideal $ \p $, that is the (Krull) dimension of the localization $ R_\p $ (looking at the definition it is easy to see that they are the same). Similarly we can define the coheight of $ \p $ as the dimension of the ideal $ \p $ (the supremum of the lenght of chanis ascending from $ \p $). \\
	For a general ideal $ I $ we define the height of $ I $ as the minimum height of its prime ideals (for proposition \ref{prop:minprimes} we can consider only the associated ones) and the \textbf{big height of $ I $} as the maximal height of its associated primes. \\
	An example of a non trivial use of theorem \ref{teo:cont:bigh} on a fat-point subscheme came directly from \cite[2.3]{EinLazSmi01}:
	
	\begin{ex}
	Consider a reduced\footnote{A scheme is reduced if and only if the associated ideal is radical} fat point subscheme $ Z = m_1 p_1 + ... +  m_k p_k$ (o more simply a finite set of points) in $ \PP^2 $, since the subscheme has dimension $ 0 $ the ideal has big height $ 2 $, so we have $ \cont{2m}{m} $ for $ I = I(Z) $. Using Theorem \ref{teo:zarnaga} this implies that all $ F $ with multiplicity $ \geq 2m $ (greater or equal than $ 2m_im $ for all the points $ p_i $) stays in $ I(Z)^m $. 
	\end{ex}
	
	Given that $ k[x_0, ... , x_N] $ is a regular ring (this is a consequence of the Hilbert's syzygy theorem \textbf{? ? ?}) and that obviously the big hieght of every homogeneous ideal $ I $ is less than the dimension of the ring ($ N $) we have a more geometrically form of theorem \ref{teo:cont:bigh}, that states $ \cont{Nm}{m} $ for all positive $ m $. %TODO Posso farlo per la varietà?

		Nell'atricolo di Szemberg nel teorema 1.3 non richiede che I sia radicale (può essere che assuma essere l'ideale di uno schema ridotto), mi sono perso qualcosa? Mentre lo chiedono nell'articolo di Ein quando fa il discorso per la dimensione della varietà n= dim(X)\\
		Why associated?\\
		Are them the minimal\\
		And embedded primes from def 2.6 of Grifo symbolic power\\
		Should I insert the definition of Krull dimension??

\section{The resurgence}
To mesure the containment property we can some constants associated to the ideal $ I $, on of them is the \textbf{resurgence}, proposed in \cite{Boc09resurgence}:
\begin{deff}
	For a proper non-zero ideal $ I $ in a commutative ring $ R $ we define the resurgence of $ I $ as:
	\begin{equation*}
		\rho(I)= \sup \left\lbrace \frac{m}{r} \, | \, I^{(m)} \not \subseteq I^r \right\rbrace 
	\end{equation*}
\end{deff}
Bounding the resurgence of an ideal means finding a constant such that for $ \frac{m}{r} > \rho $ mean that $ \cont{m}{r} $ holds.
For example using this quantity we can express the Theorem \ref{teo:cont:bigh} as:
\begin{teo}
	For a radical nonzero ideal in a regular ring $ \rho(I) \leq h $ where $ h $ is the big height of $ I $
\end{teo}
In general this is not an optimal bound and since it is difficult to directly evaluate $ \rho(I) $ we can pose the question when the resurgence is strictly less than the big height. 

Another constant, closely related to $ \rho $, is the \textbf{asymptotich resurgence} (introduced in \cite{Guardo2012}), defined as:
\begin{deff}
	For a homogeneous nonzero proper ideal $ I $ of $ k[x_0 , ... , x_n] $ the asymptotic resurgence $ \rho_a(I) $ is:
	\[ \rho_a(I) = \sup \left\lbrace \frac{m}{r} \, | \, I^{(mt)} \not \subseteq I^{rt} \text{ for all } t \gg 0 \right\rbrace \]
\end{deff}

Introduzione sugli steiner configurations and their use (maybe)
\end{tcolorbox}

A \textbf{Steiner system} $ (V,B) $ of type $ S(t,n,v) $ is an \textit{hypergraph} with $ |V|=v $ and all the elements of $ B $, called blocks, are $ n $-subsets (of $ V $) such that every $ t $-tuple of elements in $ V $ is contained in only one block of $ B $. \\
To be more clear we recall that an hypergraph $ (V,B) $ is a generalization of the normal graph, in which $ V $ is a finite set and $ B $ contains non-empty subset of $ V $ called hyperedges (a normal graph conatins only pairs) such that they cover $ V $ ($ \bigcup_{H \in B} H = V $).

\begin{deff}
A finite set of points $ Z \subset \PP^n $ is a \textbf{star configuaration of points} of degree $ d \geq n $ if there exists $ d $ general hyperplanes such that the points of $ Z $ exactly the ones that are intersection of $ n $ of these hyperplanes.
\end{deff}
By general position we mean that any group of $ n $ hyperplanes intersect in only one point and there is no point belonging to more than $ n $ hyperplanes. It also used the notation $ d $-star to emphasize the degree.
